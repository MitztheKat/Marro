	<!-- Biomes Stuff -->
	
	<!-- Patches in crops to wild biomes.  Crops with excessive .0000's represent plants that are growable
		in that biome, but don't actually show up except possibly on super rare you-should-buy-a-lottery-ticket occasions. 
		Having them all right here helps to make making changes easier and lets modders see what spawns/grows where. 
		All plants have the 'must be wild to sow' tag in order to make this work properly, unless of course they're meant to be grown in any biome.-->
